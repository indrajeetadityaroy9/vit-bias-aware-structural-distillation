# BASD: Bias-Aware Structural Distillation via Grassmannian Geometry

BASD is an architecture-agnostic distillation method that transfers teacher inductive bias from token structure, not logits alone. The objective combines classification loss with redundancy suppression, relational geometry matching, attention alignment, and Bures-Wasserstein distribution matching on generic `(B, N, D)` tokens. Teacher features are mixed per student layer using Grassmannian subspace distances in a learned shared space, with Stiefel retraction to maintain projection orthonormality. Optimization uses staggered warmup and uncertainty-based loss weighting under a dual-view protocol (clean teacher input, strongly augmented student input).
